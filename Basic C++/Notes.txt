Instead of : #include <iostream> we can use 
             #include <bits/stdc++.h> which include every library all of it.

             it takes bit more time to compile

PATTERNS :
Most of the patterns use nested loop..
outer and inner loops
outer loops is for rows and inner loop is for columns



1. for the outer loop, count the no. of lines.
2. for the inner loop, focus on the coloums & connect them somehow to the rows.

3. print  them ' * ' inside the outer for loop.
